# Smart Contract Testing Guide

## Overview

Tests in this folder are exclusively for smart contracts (under `code/contracts`) and some core library functions related to small contracts (under `code/lib`). 

Tests for other components, such as the relayer, the client, and the core library, are provided at separate locations.

### Running the tests

It is recommended that you run tests against a local Ganache instance. Please refer to the documentation at [`code/env/README.md`](https://github.com/polymorpher/one-wallet/tree/master/code/env).

The tests have deep logging functionality controlled by the `VERBOSE` flag

* `VERBOSE=1` or `VERBOSE=true` turns on debugging logging
* `VERBOSE=0` or `VERBOSE=false` runs in a quieter mode


To run the complete set of tests use
```
yarn test
```

To run a specific suite of tests in a file use
```
VERBOSE=1 truffle test test/general.js --network=dev
```

To run an individual test use
```
VERBOSE=0 truffle test --network=ganache --compile-none --grep 'AD-WALLET-1'
```
## Test Data Overview
Before each test we deploy the OneWallet Contracts and test data (through ulitity helper functions in `util.js`). The form of users and token contracts funded as follows

### Test Users
All users are funded with HALF_ETH (half the native token) and initially have a SpendingLimit of ONE_ETH (one native token). Also alice is funded with tokens as follows
* alice: Primary user funded with 1000 testerc20, 2 testerc721 tokens [2,3], 50 testerc115 tokens [(2,20),(3,30)]
* bob: used  for testing token transfers from alice and tracking tokens
* carol: used for testing backlinks with alice
* dora: used for testing overriding backlinks
* ernie: general purpose user

We deploy the following contracts using account[0] with the following initial funds, some of which are used to fund alice
* ERC20: testerc20 10000000 of which 1000 are used to fund alice
* ERC721: testerc721 10 tokens [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] of which [2,3] are used to fund alice
* ERC1155: testerc1155 10 tokens [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] with quantities of [10,20,30,40,50,66,70,80,90,100] of which [(2,20),(3,30)] are used to fund alice

We also deploy the following contracts which can be used for additional tracking or transfer function (no initial funding is done from these contracts)
* ERC20: testerc20 10000000 
* ERC721: testerc721 10 tokens [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] 
* ERC1155: testerc1155 10 tokens [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] with quantities of [10,20,30,40,50,66,70,80,90,100]

### Writing Smart Contract Tests

Below is an overview of writing tests for a new operation or new test area. For tests extending an existing area, please follow the code conventions and structures in the corresponding file.

**First Postive Use Case** 

First, create a new file and write out how you expect a successful operation to play out. Please feel free to refer to examples in `tokens.js` and others.

* **Test and Expected Result:** Place this in comments at the top of the test

* **Test Name:** Uniquely identify the test and state what the test is for e.g. `TN-BASIC-0 TRACK: must be able to track ERC20 tokens`. Here the test identifier `TN-BASIC-0` helps another person to run this test individually.

* **Initialization and Setup:** Here you create and fund your wallets and create any tokens that may be needed for the test. Note there are a nuumber of utility functions such as `makeWallet` and `makeTokens` which simplify the process. Also note that when populating the seed for the wallet, ensure that it is unique accross all the tests by using a naming convention similar to `<test identifier>-1` e.g. `TN-BASIC-0-1`

* **Executing the Transactions** You may use functions such as `commitReveal` to simplify the execution, which wraps around the two-phase commit-reveal process required by the wallet. Please also check `executeTokenTransaction` in `token.js` which provides an example of how to simplify the execution even further. When you need to execute multiple transactions within a short amount of time, please use `bumpTestTime`, which artificially increase the time on the blockchain so you can bypass the default limitation of 1 operation per (30-second) interval for the wallet.

* **Validating Wallet State:** After completing the operation, you may validate the state of the wallet to ensure that the expected items have changed. Individual tests and assertions are used to compare the state of the wallet before the operation to the state after. `getState` is a helper function which you may use to take a snapshot of the wallet's state. A common pattern is to get the wallet's state prior to a transaction, execute the transaction, manually change part of the snapshot, then compare the latest snapshot with the modified state using `assertStateEqual`. See `TN-BASIC-0` in `token.js` for an example.
 
**Event Testing:** After ensuring you have a basic positive test for the operation, you may expand on the testing coverage checking event emissions. See `events.js` for some example. The structure is similar to that of operational testing, but here we leverage events emitted by the wallet, and we add multiple scenarios for each operation.

**Functional Testing:** provides composability and scenario testing for use cases that occur in practice. These tests are written for each functional area. This is yet to be implemented. More details will be added soon.
